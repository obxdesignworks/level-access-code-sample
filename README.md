# Level Access Code Example

This is a simple form example for the Level Access accessibility consultant opportunity, written by [William Dodson](https://williamdodson.co).

## Up and Running

Open up `index.html` in your web browser and try submitting the form with empty fields or with different values.

### Correct Values

* Username: `level`
* Password: `Access123`

All other values will trigger the form validation. Entering the correct values will redirect to a thank you page.

_Note: if you have Node.js installed you can run `npm run serve` from the root folder of the project to start up a lightweight web server on [localhost port 3333 (http://localhost:3333)](http://localhost:3333)._

__GitHub repo: I also set up a [GitHub repo here](https://github.com/obxdesignworks/level-access-code-sample). You will need Node.js installed first and then you can install all of the project dependencies by running `npm install` from the project root folder.__
